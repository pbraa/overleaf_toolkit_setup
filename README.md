This is a simple workaround for a few issues I've encountered while setting up overleaf.

There are two scripts. First, run overleaf1.sh. Once that has completed, go to <host-ip>/launchpad to set up an administrator account. Do not continue before doing so.
After setting up the administrator account you can shut down the overleaf instance using CTRL+C before running the overleaf2.sh script.
